# WebCommodore
A web scraper and automation tool for getting data and creating an API to consume it.

# WORK IN PROGRESS

## How it works?
WebCommodore is a web scraper that uses an emulated headless browser and virtual DOM to get data from a website. It uses a configuration file to define the scraping process and the data to be extracted. The data is then stored in a database and an API is created to consume it.
this means you dont need a headless browser like chromium to drive the automation process, it all happens under the hood using virtualization in nodejs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the server with `npm start`
