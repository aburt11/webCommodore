A web scraper and automation tool for getting data and creating an API to consume it.

#WORK IN PROGRESS

##How it works?
WebCommodore is a web scraper that uses an emulated headless browser and virtual DOM to get data from a website. It uses a configuration file to define the scraping process and the data to be extracted. The data is then stored in a database and an API is created to consume it.

##Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the server with `npm start`
